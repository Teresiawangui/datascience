<h1>Data Science</h1>
<p>This repository has two data structures in them which are Tuples and Stack</p>
<h2>Tuples</h2>
<p>They can contain anything else: numbers, strings, lists, and even other tuples!</p>
<p>Tuple is a data type that is used to store multiple items in a single variable</p>
<p>Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values. Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0] , the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
<h2>Stack</h2>
<p>stack  is a linear data structure where data is arranged objects ana over another</p>
<p>Insertion and deletion are allowed at one end only, i.e., the 'top' of the stack.</p>
<p>LIFO refers to Last In First Out. It means that when we put data in a Stack, it processes the last entry first.</p>
