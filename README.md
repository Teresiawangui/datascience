# Data Science
This repository has two data structures in them which are Tuples and Stack.

## Tuples
They can contain anything else: numbers, strings, lists, and even other tuples!
Tuple is a data type that is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values. Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0] , the second item has index [1] etc.

## Stack
Stack  is a linear data structure where data is arranged objects ana over another.
Insertion and deletion are allowed at one end only, i.e., the 'top' of the stack.
LIFO refers to Last In First Out. It means that when we put data in a Stack, it processes the last entry first.

## Queue
This is a linear data structure that stores items in first in first out.
That means that the least recently added item is removed first.
